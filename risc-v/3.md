# ISA - instruction set architecture

## RISC-V cpus have 4 modes:

- 3 are priviliged
- 1 is unpriviliged

Most priviliged (Machine) = **M-mode**, for example when the computer turns on:
- MMU (memory management unit) is off

Then we switch into **S-mode** (Supervisor), OS runs at this level

**H-mode** is used for hardware assisted virtualization:
- privilged mode

Privilged: entitled to access something, **M-mode** is entitled to access certain registers which other modes can't access

**U-mode** is used for user space programs
- unpriviliged mode

RPL is compared to CPL, and checks if you can access something

## RISC-V is a better version than (MIPS)

Creators of RISC-V (from Berkley university):
- Anasovic
- Hennesy
- Patterson

RISC-V is open source, no license, you can you is it in any way you want

## RISC-V is modulat

There are basic mandatory requirements which we must implement
and there are extensions which we may or may not implement and there are
optional extensions

For example, if we don't need floating point math, we can skip implementing that part

We will study
- **F(loating)P(oint)** extension
- **B(ase)I(nstruction)** mandatory instructions, integers
- **A(tomic)M(emory)O(perations)** (probably not mandatory???)

## Dictionary??

- word 4B (32b)
- half-word 2B (16b) 0-65535
- double-word 8B (64b)
- quad-word 16B (128b)

Most OS run in *word* or *double-word*

Power consumption: less bits = less power, IoT devices preferably should use 32bits to save power

Instructions are always fetched in 4B packs

Compressed instructions: still fetches 4B, but gets 2 instructions, not 1, because the instruction is 2B in compressed mode

Data in memory can be in 2 layouts (origins come from "Alice in the wonderland"):
- Big endian
- Little endian


`0x1a2b3c4d` >
439041101

one of the correct answers

LE: `4d3a2b1a` (least significant byte lives in the low memory address)
BE: `1a2b3c4d` (most significant byte lives in the high memory address)

RISC-V can operate in both modes

## Difference between LE / BE

LE:
ABCD + EFGH => ABCDEFGH

BE: (need to copy memory to achieve the same result)
ABCD + EFGH => DCBAHGEF

All networks run in BE mode:

`192.168.8.37`

LE mode: `37.8.168.192`
BE mode: `192.168.8.37`

But we need to go to `192` first, to MSB first


## 32 General Purpose Registers (GPR)

[X0-X31]


X0:
- reading = we get always 0
- writing = we get always 0

rax: how do we write 0 to it:
- mov rax, 0 (2 cycles)
- mov rax, X0 (1 cycle)
- xor, rax, rax

X1 - return address

myFunc( 0xabc )

instruction to jump to function
- a1: jal (jump and link) X1, rs (contains the address of the function)
- a2: *another instruction**
- jal writes into x1 = a1 + 4 (the next instruction when it returns go to that shiit)

## RAS (Return Address Stack)

There are 2 jumps:
- as a function call (will return): jal X1
- simple jump (literally just jumps to another instructions, never comes back): jal X0

## Misc

There is not **NOT** in RISC-V
