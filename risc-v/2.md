1. Pipeline
2. RISC vs CISC
3. Compilers

Humanity **was** better at making cpus than compilers

## Logical pipeline

5 steps

1. FETCH the instructions from the ram into L1:I cache
2. DECODING instructions
3. DECODING parameters (finding which physical registers map to logical registers)
4. FETCHING parameters from the ram
5. EXECUTE (+ 11-15 stages to do this)

MSB - most significant bit
LSB - least significant bit

CISC - complete instructions, but they limit what the compiler can do
RISC - reduced instructions, ???

RISC:
- instructions are 4 bytes in length
- simple and fast to calculate instruction length & distance
- ld/st load/store only 2 operations to interact with ram
- reads / writes operations into the registers
    - ld r1, (m1)
    - ld r2, (m2)
    - add r3, r2, r1
    - st (m3), r3

CISC:
- instructions can be from 1 - 15 bytes
- length is decided by the opcode
- complex and expensive to calculate instruction length & distance
- reads / writes operations into the registers **AND** the parameters
    - add r1, (m1), (m2)


The opcode takes the same amount of storage always and is in LSB (wtf is that), it is easy to parse

32 - opcode = 24 bits
24 - 3 parameters = 9 bits

Pipeline stalling: when instructions take a lot of cycles

Out of order execution: reorder instructions when it does not change the final result:
- the cpu can reorder instructions if it will make it more efficient (more operations / cycle)

RISC vs CISC order reordering: CISC operations are more complex, so you can't break them down into parts and reorder efficiently

EXECUTE stages define how far you can move the instructions

Context switch: switch between processes on a single core
- we have to flush the pipeline, therefore pipeline can't be big
