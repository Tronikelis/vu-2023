# X0 - X31

ABI - Application Binary Interface (defined which registers are callee saved / caller saved)

Logical names vs ABI names

Most risc-v registers do not carry any semantic value

Flat application: 1 main function (lol who does this)

A (caller) calls B (callee (responsibility to save & restore registers)):
- A is free to use all of the registers
- B is not free to use A's registers, it saves them, does whatever, then writes them back

Compiler decides whether it is worth it to save & restore registers by the callee or just use ram

## Special registers

Special by the ABI / Special from the hardware implementation

X1,X5 - link registers

jalr - jump and link register, highly optimized if used with X1 or X5, has different hardware implementation

X0 - hardware
X1 - hardware
X2 - abi
X5 - hardware


X2 - stack pointer

Stack:
- push
- pop

Put a value into the stack: SP + 4, now we have space
Remove a value SP - 4, now we forgot about old data, but didn't remove it


X10-X17 are reserved for parameters
X10-X11 are used for return values (optional)

But we can have as many parameters as we want (if not in a syscall, we can push as many parameters on the stack as needed)

UNIX syscalls take max 6 parameters

Kernel manages all of the hardware

Physical page: kernel maps to user, user syscalls, kernel unmaps and maps to self, checks parameters, then maps back to user

PC / IP - instruction pointer points to the current instruction, it is hidden

RISC-V instructions are little endian and 4B long, must be aligned on 32 bits
