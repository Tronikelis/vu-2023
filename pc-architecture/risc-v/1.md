- CPU
- SBC (single board computer)
- RAM

An object can't change external state by not changing its internal state

## RAM

RAM (random access memory) *passive* -> being changed by the CPU

(Dynamic)RAM -> capacitator based, <25% charge 0, 75%>= charge 1

Every time you access it, it discharges a little bit, you need to charge every single time

Capacitators leak charge to other capacitators, we have to drain them

Not accessible all the time

Every 60ms the ram locks up, cpu does not allow mutations and it drains / charges the ram

## CPU

Before CPU was 1 core, the CPU *was* the core

Now it is the thing on which the cores live

The chip is the **book** and the **pages** are the **cores**

The only external device that the cpu can read and write is RAM

The only internal device that the cpu can talk to is the interrupt controller

Book:
- Cores / ALU (arithmetical & logical unit)
- Memory controllers 80% of the transistors
- CPU caches
- Registers (32 general purpose registers for RISC-V)

There are more registers but you can't access them

Each core has its own internal interrupt controller

I/O -> external interrupt controller (like an API for the devices) -> many internal cpu interrupt controllers

Access speed:
1. Register
2. Caches
3. Ram

Caches:
- L1
- L2
- L3

1 CPU cycles take:
- Register update
- Cache TLB


L1 cache = up to 5 cycles
L2 cache = up to 15 cycles
L3 cache = up to 50 cycles

RAM = 150 - 300 cycles

Registers are limited by the speed of light, heat and distance

Experience shows that designing a cpu to have 32 registers performs the best with account to the price

Exclusive cache means that the data lives in only one cache (normalized)

Inclusive cache lives in all the possible layers (not normalized), need to change the data in all the possible layers

Ram stores either data or instructions

L1 cache is split into:
- cpu instruction data
- general data

Every single core has its own L1 cache (nothing is shared) 32+ Kbs
L2 cache is shared by all the cores (shared by cores) 100+ Kbs
L3 cache is outside of the book (shared by books) 16Mbs+

**All caches are S-RAMS**

Pre-heating: copying the instructions from the RAM to the L caches
